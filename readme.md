Full Stack Web Development — My Learning Journey

Hey there 👋  
This repo is where I’m documenting everything I learn while going through **Full Stack Web Development** 
— from the very basics (how the Internet works) to building and deploying real web applications.

I’m not copying tutorials here. I’m writing down what I **actually understood**, what confused me
and how things connect behind the scenes.  

This is more like my **engineering lab book** for the web.

## What This Repo Includes

- Notes (In form of comments) that explain things in my own words  
- Code snippets and example files for each concept  
- A day-wise structure so I can track progress over time  
- Real-world explanations of *why* something works, not just *how*

## Why I’m Doing This

I’ve seen too many people rush through HTML, CSS, and JS, React — but I want to **actually understand**
what’s happening at every layer.  

So this repo is my way to:

- Build a **strong base** for real-world development  
- Have my own quick revision notes before interviews  
- Keep everything organized (theory + code + practice)  
- Learn how the web truly works under the hood
