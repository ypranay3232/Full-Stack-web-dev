# 🚀 100 Days of Code — Full Stack Web Development  
### My Engineering Learning Journal

Hey there 👋  

This repository documents my **100 Days of Code** journey focused on **Full Stack Web Development** — starting from the fundamentals (how the Internet works) to building, deploying, and reasoning about real-world web applications.

This is **not a tutorial dump**.  
Everything here reflects:
- what I *actually understood*
- where I got confused
- how concepts connect behind the scenes

Think of this repo as my **engineering lab notebook for the web**.

---

## 🧠 What This Repository Includes

- 📘 **Concept notes** written in my own words (as comments & markdown)
- 🧩 **Code snippets & mini-experiments** for each topic
- 📅 **Day-wise structure** to track consistent progress
- 🌍 **Real-world explanations** — why things exist, not just how to use them
- 🔍 Clear mental models instead of surface-level APIs

---

## 🎯 Why I’m Doing This

Most people rush through:
HTML → CSS → JavaScript → React → “Done”.

That creates **framework operators**, not engineers.

My goals with this repo:
- Build a **strong foundation** that scales with complexity
- Understand the **web stack end-to-end**
- Create **quick revision material** for interviews
- Keep **theory + code + reasoning** in one place
- Learn to **think like a system**, not just write syntax

---

## 🧱 Learning Philosophy

- No blind copy-pasting
- No skipping fundamentals
- No memorizing APIs without understanding
- If I can’t explain it simply, I don’t understand it


## 🧩 Who This Is For

- My future self
- Interview preparation
- Anyone who wants **clarity**, not shortcuts
- Engineers who care about fundamentals

---
## 🏁 End Goal

By Day 100, I should be able to:
- Explain how the web works **without hand-waving**
- Build full-stack apps confidently
- Debug issues using **first principles**
- Think beyond frameworks
- Design systems with intent
