<!-- What is a Tag, A Tag is a Keyword or instruction for browser to render a specific detail or format of a element 
 
Html is interpreted by web browser at runtime it is called "rendering"
Okay lets write something and go live ! as we can see we can see it live on browser
-->

Hello world ! 
<!-- we have a proper way or structure on writing html code !

<! DOCTYPE html> : it means we are declaring the following document in html format (it is a syntax or format for HTML5) : it tells the browser to use standard Html format to render and support the code 

<html lang="en"> : This tag means we are writing the document in english primarily

<Head> </head> : contains Meta data of a website which is not visible content, But plays a crucial role in instructing the web browser about enconding formats,viewport,stylessheets,scripts etc

metadata = > Informatin about an information

<meta charset="UTF-8"> : Universal text format -8(bits), this tells the browser how to read and display characters inside the Html file. 

Why we use it is because : it not only supports (A-Z) but also support : 
Latin characters :  é, ñ, ü

Non-English scripts : नमस्ते, 你好, こんにちは

Emojis 😎🔥❤️


so : <meta charset="UTF-8">  : This line tells the browser:

“Hey, read this file using UTF-8 so you can show every symbol correctly.”


UTF-8 declared:

<meta charset="UTF-8">
<p>Café 😊 नमस्ते</p>


You’ll see:
Café 😊 नमस्ते


No UTF-8 declared (defaults to old encoding):
You’ll see something broken like:
CafÃ© ðŸ˜Š à¤¨à¤®à¤¸à¥à¤¤à¥‡



<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"> : Each mobile has a viewport(view area) so that the mobiles can view the desktop pages scaled down to mobile format.

Content="width-device-width" : means sets the width of a user using mobile width. 

Initial-scaling = 1.0  : zoom level is bydefault set to 100%


<title> : is the headding of a webpage which is shown on tabs. improtant for SEO

<body> : The document rendering content area. Body runs after Dom construcion 

</html> : all of these are wrapped inside html file

<body>
    <p>This is a paragraph tag</p>
    <!-- The <p> tag contains 3 things : 
            1) opening Tag 
            2) closing Tag

<!-- Html Elements are categorized in to two types : 
1) block : elements which Takes the entire line of space and starts at new line : <p>,<h1> to <h6>.
The block elements are used to seperate : headding,paragraph,list,article etc.
