Lets see what is a HTTP : It is a Hyper text transfer protocol that enables communication between Browser and server Through request and response.

HTTP is a TCP/IP based protocol. It enables a communication between client and server via a handshake by depending on TCP/IP. 

Tcp port number = 80
HTTPS : uses = 443

How the Internet & Web Actually Work
1️⃣ What is the Internet?

The Internet is a global network of interconnected computers and devices that communicate using standard protocols (like TCP/IP).

It enables data exchange, communication, and web services globally.

📦 Key Components:
Component	Description :

Router	    Directs data packets between networks.
Gateway	    Connects two different networks.
Modem	    Converts digital → analog signals (and vice versa).
Server	    A computer that stores and serves data/resources.
Client	    The device that requests information (e.g., your browser).

2️⃣ How Data Travels (The Real Pipeline)
Data doesn’t travel as a full “file” — it’s broken into packets of bits (0s and 1s).

Step-by-step flow when you visit google.com:

Browser sends a DNS request to resolve the domain → IP address.

Data travels via routers, ISPs, and gateways using TCP/IP.

The HTTP request is sent to the target web server.

The server sends an HTTP response with web data (HTML, CSS, JS, images).

Browser renders and displays the webpage.


🧭 3️⃣ DNS (Domain Name System)

Purpose: Converts domain names (like example.com) → IP addresses (142.250.191.46).

Works like the Internet’s phonebook.

📂 DNS Lookup Process:

Browser checks local cache.

If not found → Queries DNS resolver.

Resolver checks root, TLD, and authoritative DNS servers.

Once resolved → IP is returned to the browser.

🧠 Mnemonic:
Cache → Resolver → Root → TLD → Authoritative → IP

🧩 4️⃣ IP Address (Device Identifier)

IP (Internet Protocol) gives every device a unique identity on the network.

Two major versions:

IPv4: 192.168.1.1

IPv6: 2400:cb00:2048:1::c629:d7a2

🚀 Fun Fact:

IPv4 has ~4.3 billion unique addresses; IPv6 exists because IPv4 was running out.

🔐 5️⃣ TCP/IP Protocol Stack
Layer	                Example Protocols	Function
Application Layer	    HTTP, FTP, SMTP	    End-user communication
Transport Layer	        TCP, UDP	        Reliable or fast delivery
Internet Layer	        IP	                Routing packets
Network Access Layer	Ethernet, Wi-Fi	    Physical transmission

💡 Trick to Remember:
A–T–I–N → “All Teachers Inspire Networking”

6️⃣ HTTP / HTTPS
Protocol	    Full Form	            Port	                Security	         Description
HTTP	        HyperText Transfer      Protocol	80	        ❌ Plain text       Transfers web data between client ↔ server
HTTPS	        HyperText Transfer      Protocol Secure	443	    ✅ SSL/TLS	       Encrypted communication


🔄 Workflow:

Client sends HTTP Request

Server sends HTTP Response

Browser renders received HTML

Mnemonic:
REQ → RES → RENDER


7️⃣ Browser: The Real Workhorse

A browser (like Chrome, Firefox, Edge) is a software engine that retrieves, interprets, and displays HTML documents.

Browser Architecture:

Component	                Function
User Interface (UI)	        Everything you interact with (tabs, address bar, etc.)
Browser Engine	            Manages actions between UI and rendering engine
Rendering Engine        	Parses HTML/CSS and displays the webpage
Networking Layer        	Handles HTTP requests/responses
JavaScript Engine	        Executes JS code (e.g., Chrome’s V8 Engine)
Data Storage	            Cookies, localStorage, sessionStorage, cache


Browser Rendering Steps:

Parse HTML → Create DOM Tree

Parse CSS → Create CSSOM Tree

Combine into Render Tree

Layout → Calculate element positions

Paint → Draw pixels on screen



8️⃣ HTTP Request Lifecycle (Example)
Scenario: You open https://example.com

Browser checks cache/DNS.

Makes a TCP connection (Handshake).

Sends HTTP GET request.

Server processes → Sends back HTML response.

Browser renders the HTML + requests CSS/JS/images.

Displays the final webpage.


9️⃣ Client–Server Model
Term	Role
Client	Requests resources (your browser)
Server	Provides resources (web server)


💡 The client initiates; the server responds.

Example:

Client: "GET /index.html"
Server: "200 OK + HTML file"


🔟 Cookies, Cache & Sessions : 
Concept	Purpose	Stored In

Cookies	Store small user data like login state	Browser
Cache	Store static assets for faster reload	Browser
Session	Maintains temporary user data	Server or browser memory


🧠 Real-World Example

When you open https://youtube.com:

DNS resolver translates to IP.

HTTPS request is sent securely.

Server returns HTML, CSS, JS.

Browser engine renders video thumbnails.

JS engine activates the play button dynamically.
