# Music Composer (BeatMaker)

A dynamic, interactive beat maker application built with vanilla JavaScript. This project allows users to compose their own loop-based music using three different tracks: Kick, Snare, and Hi-hat.

## Features

-   **Multi-Track Sequencer**: Compose beats using Kick, Snare, and Hi-hat tracks.
-   **Sound Selection**: Choose from multiple sound kits for each instrument (Classic, 808, Heavy, Acoustic).
-   **Tempo Control**: Adjust the playback speed (BPM) in real-time with a slider.
-   **Mute Controls**: Individually mute or unmute tracks to isolate sounds.
-   **Visual Feedback**:
    -   Active pads glow and scale when triggered.
    -   Smooth animations for a responsive feel.
-   **Modern UI**: Sleek dark mode design with "Work Sans" typography and pastel color accents.

## Technologies Used

-   **HTML5**: Structure and semantic markup.
-   **CSS3**: Custom styling, Flexbox layout, CSS Variables, and Keyframe animations.
-   **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) class structure to manage state, audio playback, and DOM interaction.
-   **Boxicons**: Scalable vector icons for UI elements.
-   **Google Fonts**: "Work Sans" for modern typography.
