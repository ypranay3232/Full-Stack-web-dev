Today we are learning about HTML Elements.

HTML is a markup language, it means it adds extra annotations to language.(turns a text into bold)

HTML instructs the browser about the content structure and its meaning. 

Using HTML Tags. (<h1> </h1> is a tag, and A tag has Opening(<h1>) and closing Tags(</h1>).)
Opening and closing tags are used to tell the browser where a element starts and where it ends.

HTML elements are : <h1>Hello World</h1>. (the Hello World is Element Content)
