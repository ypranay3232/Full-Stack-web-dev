The first project that im starting is A Counter app.

Project 001: The Counter
Series: 100 Projects Without AI/Google

Status: Completed (The Hard Way)

🎯 The Mission
Build a functional counter with "Increment," "Decrement," and "Reset" functionality.

🧠 The "No-Google" Experience
Even for a counter project its a bit different. Here is what I realized:

The Struggle: I hesitated on the exact syntax for addEventListener for a second.
Usually, I'd just let Copilot finish it, but forcing myself to remember it felt a lil struggle.

The Win: I successfully managed the state without needing to check a tutorial.

What I learned: Basic DOM manipulation,centering the counter. But I need to be more confident. 
This is not enough !
