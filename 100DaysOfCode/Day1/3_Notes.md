What is a URL : 
Uniform Resource Locator, is automatically entered by browsers when you search for something 
the URL is an Address to Visit any Site, Often included with Domain Name

When a user enters a URL : 
He specify what protocol to use (https://)
Where the server is, what resource to ask for (www.example.com:443/products?id=42#reviews)

The Server sees (/reviews section) but when a user access his account details or important sections
A hashing/fragmentation is done at client side. so client sees it as : (account/f70c0e517)

But server sees it as : (account/demouser)

so fragmentation/hashing is not sent to server its only done at user side by js/browser.


HTTPS : Hypertext transfer protocol used to establish a communication medium between two devices
remote to server. HTTPS is secure compared to HTTP, because http sends data in plain text. 

Https uses TLS (Transport layer security)

After Domain name anything is just Path (amazon/products) here products is path
